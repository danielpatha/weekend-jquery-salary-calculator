Raw Notes:





Steps:
1. Step up the header using HTML and CSS. Done!

2.Set up the inputs and buttons within the <main> Done!
This is we use input instead of text area since that is used for multiple lines of info.
Couldn't figure out how to get the button to the right.

3. Make the bare bones of the table. Done!
Had to put this is CSS to make the lines of the table actually show. It just words before LOL.
table,td,th{
    border: 1px solid black;
}
td,th{
    padding: 8px 14px;
}

4.Now let's do the logic to make this button submit on to the table.
